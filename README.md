# SteamControllerProfiles

This repository contains my controller profiles to use with `sc-controller` (https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller). All configurations may be updated as I use them. Each configuration is stored in its own folder with (maybe) a more in-depth README file.

## i3 

Fully-functional desktop navigation for the i3 window manager with the steam controller. *TODO:* Directly call i3-msg whenever possible instead of relying on hotkeys being present.

## Games

I have configurations for several games that I cannot play on steam (I use wine / no native steam port):

- **Killer is Dead**: Keyboard configuration of the game, since gamepad won't work under wine.
- **Homefront**: Uses gyro for high precision aiming. No menu for weapons since that forced me to stop moving. Instead the right trackpad is converted into a mousewheel when the left bumper is pressed, so weapons can be changed on the fly.
- **Diablo 3**: Experimental configuration for Diablo 3 (WIP). Many things are not done yet.
